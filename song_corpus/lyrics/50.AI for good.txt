[VERSE]
From code to the clouds, machines learn to grow
Data’s the fuel, let the bright ideas flow
Robots that heal, servers hum strong
Every byte sings a world where we all belong
[PRECHORUS]
Hand in hand, we design tomorrow’s light
Hand in hand, now the future’s in sight
[CHORUS]
AI for good, we shout the refrain
Hearts linked as one, breaking the chain
From east to the west, together we rise
Co-Creating a future where all dreams take flight
[VERSE]
AI in schools, in farms, in our hands
Transforming cities, reviving the land
Factories smart, new tech takes flight
Science meets kindness to make wrongs turn right
[PRECHORUS]
Hand in hand, we design tomorrow’s light
Hand in hand, now the future’s in sight
[CHORUS]
AI for good, we shout the refrain
Hearts linked as one, breaking the chain
From east to the west, together we rise
Co-Creating a future where all dreams take flight
