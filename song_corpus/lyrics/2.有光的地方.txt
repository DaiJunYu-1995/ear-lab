[Verse 1]
Locked inside a room without a door
Staring at the shadows on the floor
They told me I should keep my voice down low
But there’s a fire starting, don’t they know

[Verse 2]
I gathered all the stones they threw at me
Built a castle where I could be free
No more waiting for a lucky break
I’m writing down the path that I will take

[Chorus]
Watch me rise, watch me fly
Like a phoenix in the sky
I am burning, I am bright
I’m taking back the night

[Chorus]
Hear the drum, hear the sound
I am shaking up the ground
Nothing’s gonna hold me back
I’m on the attack
I am rising up!

[Bridge]
Scars are just the armor that I wear
Proof that I survived the lion's lair
I’m stronger than I ever was before
Hear me roar!

[Outro]
Rising up...
Rising up...
Yeah, I’m rising up.
