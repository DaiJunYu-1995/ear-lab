[Intro]
Soft rain, soft heart

[Verse 1]
The rain hits soft against my window
Like it knows the words I couldn’t say
I write your name, then erase it
Afraid I’ll never walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
I hold my breath, I count to three
Trying to let you leave me

[Chorus 1]
Before the rain is gone
I miss you, quiet and strong
Even if we fell apart
You still live inside my heart

[Verse 2]
Streetlights flicker at the corner
Like unfinished lines in our goodbye
I learn to loosen up my fingers
And let the past just pass me by

[Chorus 2]
Before the rain is gone
I miss you, then move on
When the next clear day arrives
I’ll find myself, I’ll be alright

[Bridge]
If love was a lesson, I learned it slow
I’ll keep the warmth, let the rest go
