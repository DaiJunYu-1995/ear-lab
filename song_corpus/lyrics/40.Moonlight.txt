[Verse 1]
Raindrops tapping on the window pane
Thinking 'bout the future, playing mental games
Coffee cup is empty, clock is ticking slow
Got a lot of places that I wanna go

[Verse 2]
Pages turning over, study by the lamp
World outside is quiet, world outside is damp
Headphones on my ears, beat is in my chest
Trying to find a moment, trying to find some rest

[Chorus]
Just vibing in the moonlight, taking it slow
Letting all the worries and the stress just go
It’s a lofi feeling, floating in the air
No need to rush, no need to care

[Chorus]
Just drifting in the silence, finding my flow
Watching how the city lights begin to glow
Yeah it’s alright, yeah it’s okay
We’ll make it through another day

[Outro]
Yeah...
Just breathe...
Keep it chill...
Goodnight.
